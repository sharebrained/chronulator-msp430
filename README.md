Description
===========

An analog panel meter clock implementation based on the
Texas Instruments MSP430 microcontroller.

Time is displayed via two analog meters, one for hours
and one for minutes. The microcontroller keeps time via
a 32.768kHz crystal, and controls the meter needles
using pulse-width modulation of current sources.

The current sources are adjustable by variable
resistors, and the time is set by momentary buttons.
